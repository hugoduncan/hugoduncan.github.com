      <h1>Back to blogging</h1>
<blockquote><p> “My mind turned by anxiety, or other cause, from its scrutiny of blank  paper, is like a lost child–wandering the house, sitting on the bottom  step to cry.”  — Virginia Woolf </p></blockquote><p>I was inspired to write some blog posts, which led me to realise my current blog and blogging setup were completely broken.</p><p>Michiel Borkent (<a href='https://twitter.com/borkdude'>@borkdude</a>) recently wrote about his <a href='https://blog.michielborkent.nl/migrating-octopress-to-babashka.html'>migration from Octopress</a>. His requirements were very similar to mine, so I copied and modified. Thank you Michiel!</p><p>His blog, <a href='https://blog.michielborkent.nl/'>REPL adventures</a>, is well worth the read.</p><h2>Blog Post Discussions</h2><p>With a static web site, the perennial problem is how to enable discussions.  Some people just punt pn this, and point to reddit, but Michiel's solution is to use github discussions.  As a way of owning the discussion, this has a lot of appeal.</p><p>I think it could be taken further.  It would be great if we could automate the creation of a blog post topic when creating a blog post. Unfortunately the <a href='https://cli.github.com/'><code>gh</code></a> command line client doesn't support discussions yet, so that would require using Github's GraphQL API - more work than I wanted to do for now.</p><p>One downside though, is that the discussions are not visible on the blog pages, where discussion could easily engender more discussion. I wonder if a Github Action could be triggered by conversation activity, and automatically republish the post with the discussion to date at the end of the post.</p><h2>Blogging Frameworks vs Tasks</h2><p>There are many blog site generators (I used <a href='https://gohugo.io/'>Hugo</a>, of course), even if we limit ourselves to clojure:- <a href='https://github.com/retrogradeorbit/bootleg'>bootleg</a>, <a href='https://github.com/rafaeldelboni/nota'>nota</a>, <a href='https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen'>cryogen</a>, and <a href='https://github.com/nakkaya/static'>static</a> to name a few.</p><p>These are usually feature rich.  The price for those features though, is extra complexity.</p><p>Michiel's blog uses <a href='https://book.babashka.org/'>babashka</a> tasks to add a post, render posts, etc. These are extremely quick to run and make maintaining the blog simple.  it does just what he needs, and no more.</p><p>This reminds me of project automation, and the <a href='https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build'><code>tools.build</code></a> approach of using composable code tasks to build just what is needed.</p><p>Maybe there is an opportunity to take the same approach for building a blog or static site. If we could pick from a selection of configurable tasks, maybe we wouldn't need to write our own.</p><p>Speaking of which, I have tried writing my own before, in common-lisp: <a href='http://github.com/hugoduncan/cl-blog-generator'>cl-blog-generator</a>.</p><h2>And…</h2><p>So I have a blogging setup.  Now I just need to write something.</p><p><!&mdash; [borkdude-octopress][https://blog.michielborkent.nl/migrating-octopress-to-babashka.html] [borkdude-blog][https://blog.michielborkent.nl/] [cryogen][https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen] [static][https://github.com/nakkaya/static] [nota][https://github.com/rafaeldelboni/nota] [hugo][https://gohugo.io/] [babashka][https://book.babashka.org/] [tools.build][https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build] [gh][https://cli.github.com/] [bootleg][https://github.com/retrogradeorbit/bootleg] &mdash;></p>
