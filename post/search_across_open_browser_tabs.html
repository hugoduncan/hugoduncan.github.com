      <h1>Search Across Open Browser Tabs</h1>
<p><p>I am an <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a> user, these days mainly because it gives me integrated mail, feed and news reading, so that everything that comes from the web appears in one place.  The last significant innovation I remember was the introduction of tabs, and that was some time ago (long before it made its way into IE, for example).  I am a heavy user of tabs - it is not unusual for me to have over fifty pages open, as I tend to just open pages and rarely close them again.  This means that the tab icons are unreadable, and Alt+Tab (I'm on a mac) produces three or four columns to scroll through to select the tab I'm after.  I dream of a better tab navigation model, and would love to be able to search across all the open tabs.  Surely it wouldn't be that hard to implement.</p> <p>Maybe I'm being a little harsh as there have been some other innovations.  <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox's</a> add-ons work seamlessly, we can use arbitrary search engines thanks to <a href="http://www.opensearch.org/">OpenSearch</a>, and <a href="http://conkeror.org/">Conkeror</a> gives full screen browsing with emacs key bindings, but for the most part it has been better support for standards that has dominated the release notes.</p> <p>In preparing this post, I found that Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a> has search over your page history.  Sounds like that might fulfill my wish, though I wonder how its process per tab model will scale to lots of tabs.  I just have to wait for its release on mac OS X.</p></p>
