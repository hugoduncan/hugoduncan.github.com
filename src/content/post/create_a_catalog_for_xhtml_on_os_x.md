title: "Create a Catalog for XHTML on OS X"
Pubdate: "2009-03-11"
tags: [ "html", "xhtml", "catalog", "mac", "os x"]
Description: "While trying to validate the output of cl-blog-generator I needed a local DTD for XHTML.  The textproc/xmlcatmgr package in Darwin Ports creates a catalog at /opt/local/etc/xml/catalog, but it does not include XHTML.  A flattened XHTML DTD can be found in the w3 validator library and installed the DTD's under /opt/local/share/xml/, but I couldn't find a catalog file for it.  It turns out it is pretty simple to write the catalog file; the Wikipedia XML Catalog entry has an example that contains what is needed.  Save the example next to the XHTML DTD's as catalog.xml and adjust the paths, then add a 'nextCatalog' entry in /opt/local/etc/xml/catalog pointing at the catalog.xml file."

<p>While trying to validate the output of <a href="http://hugoduncan.github.com/cl-blog-generator/content/site/index.xhtml">cl-blog-generator</a> I needed a local DTD for XHTML.  The textproc/xmlcatmgr package in Darwin Ports creates a catalog at <code>/opt/local/etc/xml/catalog</code>, but it does not include XHTML.  A flattened XHTML DTD can be found in <a href="http://validator.w3.org/sgml-lib.tar.gz">the w3 validator library</a> and installed the DTD's under <code>/opt/local/share/xml/</code>, but I couldn't find a catalog file for it.  It turns out it is pretty simple to write the catalog file; the Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Catalog">XML Catalog</a> entry has an example that contains what is needed.  Save the example next to the XHTML DTD's as <code>catalog.xml</code> and adjust the paths, then add a "nextCatalog" entry in <code>/opt/local/etc/xml/catalog</code> pointing at the <code>catalog.xml</code> file.</p>
<p>Now I can use <code>(setf cxml:*catalog* (cxml:make-catalog '("/opt/local/etc/xml/catalog")))</code> and <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/cxml/">CXML</a> will use the local DTD specified in the catalog.</p>
