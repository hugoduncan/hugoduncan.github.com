    <title>Create a Catalog for XHTML on OS X</title>
    <summary>While trying to validate the output of cl-blog-generator I needed a local DTD for XHTML.  The textproc/xmlcatmgr package in Darwin Ports creates a catalog at /opt/local/etc/xml/catalog, but it does not include XHTML.  A flattened XHTML DTD can be found in the w3 validator library and installed the DTD's under /opt/local/share/xml/, but I couldn't find a catalog file for it.  It turns out it is pretty simple to write the catalog file; the Wikipedia XML Catalog entry has an example that contains what is needed.  Save the example next to the XHTML DTD's as catalog.xml and adjust the paths, then add a 'nextCatalog' entry in /opt/local/etc/xml/catalog pointing at the catalog.xml file.</summary>
