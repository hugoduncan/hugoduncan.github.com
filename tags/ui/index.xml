The last significant innovation I remember was the introduction of tabs, and that was some time ago (long before it made its way into IE, for example).  I am a heavy user of tabs - it is not unusual for me to have over fifty pages open, as I tend to just open pages and rarely close them again.  This means that the tab icons are unreadable, and Alt+Tab (I&#39;m on a mac) produces three or four columns to scroll through to select the tab I&#39;m after.  I dream of a better tab navigation model, and would love to be able to search across all the open tabs.  Surely it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&#39;m being a little harsh as there have been some other innovations.  &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/&#34;&gt;Firefox&#39;s&lt;/a&gt; add-ons work seamlessly, we can use arbitrary search engines thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.opensearch.org/&#34;&gt;OpenSearch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://conkeror.org/&#34;&gt;Conkeror&lt;/a&gt; gives full screen browsing with emacs key bindings, but for the most part it has been better support for standards that has dominated the release notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparing this post, I found that Google&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.com/chrome&#34;&gt;Chrome&lt;/a&gt; has search over your page history.  Sounds like that might fulfill my wish, though I wonder how its process per tab model will scale to lots of tabs.  I just have to wait for its release on mac OS X.&lt;/p&gt;
